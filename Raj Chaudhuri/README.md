# Designing "Orchestrable" Applications

This session discusses how applications can be built so that they can be easily "orchestrated" - that is, managed (deployed, run, monitored, healed, scaled, updated) completely by automated systems like Kubernetes.

It describes seven things to consider while designing and developing an application, to ensure that the application is "orchestrable."

The `demo` folder contains a demo application (created using the .NET 9 SDK) in the subfolder `contanerize`, which demonstrates some of the suggestions given in the session. See its [README](demo/containerize/README.md) for details.
